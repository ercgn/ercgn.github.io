					<h2>Event Information</h2>
					<p>
						All Campus Praise Night is one night where Christians from all over CMU<br />come together to praise the one true living God of the Bible. <br />This semester, the event will be held on <strong>Feb 7, 7:30 PM @ Porter Hall 100</strong>.

									<h2>"Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed. The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light."</br> <span style="font-size: 0.5em;">(Romans 13:11-12 ESV)</span></h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Our theme this semester is <strong>AWAKENING</strong>. God's love and sacrifice for us transforms lives, but we often forget the magnitude of Christ's sacrifice and the living hope we have in His resurrection. We want to reemphasize these truths and remind Christians that we can live <strong>boldly</strong> for Christ because He is our <strong>living hope</strong>.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time." <br /> &#8213; 1 Peter 1:3-5

										<h3>We are <strong>dead</strong></h3>
									</header>
									<p>And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. <br /><small>(Ephesians 2:1-3)</small></p>

										<h3>Christ gives us <strong>life</strong></h3>
									</header>
									<p>For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. <br /><small>(Romans 8:3-4)</small></p>

										<h3>We have a <strong>living hope</strong></h3>
									</header>
									<p>How do you respond to Christ's sacrifice for you? Who or what do you hope for? What does being a new creation in Christ mean (2 Corinthians 5:17) to you? What areas in your life need an awakening? These are questions we want Christians to think about throughout the night.</p>
